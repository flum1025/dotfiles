# ===================================================================== #
# FURTHER ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
# ===================================================================== #

firmware:
  # Use legacy BIOS instead of UEFI.
  # Default: false
  legacyBIOS: false

video:
  # QEMU display, e.g., "none", "cocoa", "sdl", "gtk".
  # As of QEMU v5.2, enabling this is known to have negative impact
  # on performance on macOS hosts: https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/334
  # Default: "none"
  display: "none"

# The instance can get routable IP addresses from the vmnet framework using
# https://github.com/lima-vm/vde_vmnet.
networks:
  # Lima can manage daemons for networks defined in $LIMA_HOME/_config/networks.yaml
  # automatically. Both vde_switch and vde_vmnet binaries must be installed into
  # secure locations only alterable by the "root" user.
  # - lima: shared
  #   # MAC address of the instance; lima will pick one based on the instance name,
  #   # so DHCP assigned ip addresses should remain constant over instance restarts.
  #   macAddress: ""
  #   # Interface name, defaults to "lima0", "lima1", etc.
  #   interface: ""
  #
  # Lima can also connect to "unmanaged" vde networks addressed by "vnl". This
  # means that the daemons will not be controlled by Lima, but must be started
  # before the instance.  The interface type (host, shared, or bridged) is
  # configured in vde_vmnet and not in lima.
  # vnl (virtual network locator) points to the vde_switch socket directory,
  # optionally with vde:// prefix
  # - vnl: "vde:///var/run/vde.ctl"
  #   # VDE Switch port number (not TCP/UDP port number). Set to 65535 for PTP mode.
  #   # Default: 0
  #   switchPort: 0
  #   # MAC address of the instance; lima will pick one based on the instance name,
  #   # so DHCP assigned ip addresses should remain constant over instance restarts.
  #   macAddress: ""
  #   # Interface name, defaults to "lima0", "lima1", etc.
  #   interface: ""

# Port forwarding rules. Forwarding between ports 22 and ssh.localPort cannot be overridden.
# Rules are checked sequentially until the first one matches.
# portForwards:
#   - guestPort: 443
#     hostIP: "0.0.0.0" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"; allows privileged port forwarding
#   # default: hostPort: 443 (same as guestPort)
#   # default: guestIP: "127.0.0.1" (also matches bind addresses "0.0.0.0", "::", and "::1")
#   # default: proto: "tcp" (only valid value right now)
#
#   - guestPortRange: [4000, 4999]
#     hostIP:  "0.0.0.0" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#   # default: hostPortRange: [4000, 4999] (must specify same number of ports as guestPortRange)
#
#   - guestPort: 80
#     hostPort: 8080 # overrides the default value 80
#
#   - guestIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#     hostIP: "127.0.0.2" # overrides the default value "127.0.0.1"
#   # default: guestPortRange: [1, 65535]
#   # default: hostPortRange: [1, 65535]
#
#   - guestPort: 8888
#     ignore: true (don't forward this port)
#
#   - guestSocket: "/run/user/{{.UID}}/my.sock"
#     hostSocket: mysocket
#   # "guestSocket" can include these template variables: {{.Home}}, {{.UID}}, and {{.User}}.
#   # "hostSocket" can include {{.LimaHome}}, {{.Instance}}, {{.Home}}, {{.UID}}, and {{.User}}.
#   # Relative "hostSocket" will be based of "{{.LimaHome}}/{{.Instance}}/sock/".
#   # Sockets can also be forwarded to ports and vice versa, but not to/from a range of ports.
#   # Forwarding requires the lima user to have rw access to the "guestsocket",
#   # and the local user rwx access to the directory of the "hostsocket".
#
#   # Lima internally appends this fallback rule at the end:
#   - guestIP: "127.0.0.1"
#     guestPortRange: [1, 65535]
#     hostIP: "127.0.0.1"
#     hostPortRange: [1, 65535]
#   # Any port still not matched by a rule will not be forwarded (ignored)

# Extra environment variables that will be loaded into the VM at start up.
# These variables are consumed by internal init scripts, and also added
# to /etc/environment.
# If you set any of "ftp_proxy", "http_proxy", "https_proxy", or "no_proxy", then
# Lima will automatically set an uppercase variant to the same value as well.
# env:
#   KEY: value

# Lima will override the proxy environment variables with values from the current process
# environment (the environment in effect when you run `limactl start`). It will automatically
# replace the strings "localhost" and "127.0.0.1" with the host gateway address from inside
# the VM, so it stays routable. Use of the process environment can be disabled by setting
# propagateProxyEnv to false.
# Default: true
propagateProxyEnv: true

# The host agent implements a DNS server that looks up host names on the host
# using the local system resolver. This means changing VPN and network settings
# are reflected automatically into the guest, including conditional forward,
# and mDNS lookup:
# Default: true
useHostResolver: true

# If useHostResolver is false, then the following rules apply for configuring dns:
# Explicitly set DNS addresses for qemu user-mode networking. By default qemu picks *one*
# nameserver from the host config and forwards all queries to this server. On macOS
# Lima adds the nameservers configured for the "en0" interface to the list. In case this
# still doesn't work (e.g. VPN setups), the servers can be specified here explicitly.
# If nameservers are specified here, then the "en0" configuration will be ignored.
# dns:
# - 1.1.1.1
# - 1.0.0.1
